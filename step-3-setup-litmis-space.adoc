= Setup a LITMIS Space

Now that you know a little about PASE it's time to setup your lab on an IBM i in the cloud.  Labs are conducted on **https://kti.news/2iMWsjL[Litmis Spaces] Multi Tenant**; a service from Krengeltech to provide preconfigured open source environments on IBM i cloud instances.

**In short, everything can be done through the browser - no need to install a source editor or shell client on your desktop.  Happy day!**

Go to https://spaces.litmis.com and select **SIGN UP**, as show below.

Select the authentication mechanism of your choice.  If you don't have an account with the options listed, sign up for a free http://github.com[Github.com] profile and return back to this page once your Github profile is setup.

Once logged in you can create a new space, as shown below.

Now you should see a new box on your page that represents your newly created Space.

There are four buttons which constitute actions you can take with your Space.  They are (left to right):

- *Shell.*  You will use this to enter commands in the PASE environment on the IBM i.  This takes the place of `STRQSH` and `CALL QP2TERM` mentioned earlier.

- *Editor.*  Where you will edit your source code and navigate the IFS (Integrated File System).

- *Space Information.*  Here you will find information about your Space such as user profile, database schemas (aka libraries), ports for your web app to listen, Space id, etc. 

- *Delete Space.*  **WARNING!** If you select this option and the subsequent warning prompt, your Space will be deleted.  This **CANNOT** be undone.

## Please proceed to the next step.
