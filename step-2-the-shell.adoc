= The Shell

The https://kti.news/pase-v73[PASE] shell is a lot like a 5250 Telnet session; it's a program that takes your commands from the keyboard and hands them to the operating system to perform their associated action. It is also known as a CLI (*C*ommand *L*ine *I*nterface).

By default PASE uses the Korn Shell (aka `ksh`). One way you can enter into a PASE Korn Shell via `CALL QP2TERM` from a 5250 Telnet session, as shown below.

The `pwd` command has been keyed in and the enter key pressed.  Under the covers the `pwd` C program is invoked, does its thing, and returns output back to your shell's screen.  You can see the Linux implementation of `pwd` https://kti.news/pase-pwd[here].


== QP2TERM and QShell
If you've been on the IBM i for any amount of time you've probably been exposed to QShell.  You can start a QShell session by typing QSH.  You'll notice QShell looks *very* similar to `CALL QP2TERM`.

The primary difference between these two environments is that QShell is based on the ILE environment and CALL QP2TERM is based on AIX.  For 99% of what you do you will stay away from QShell because it doesn't operate correctly in certain circumstances.  The few scenarios you will use it involve starting a shell script from a 5250 session; but it will in turn enter into a real PASE shell.
```
SBMJOB CMD(QSH CMD('/path/to/script.sh parm1 parm2'))
```

A significant amount of more information concerning PASE shells can be found on the https://kti.news/yips-pase-shell[YiPs site] where Tony Cairns (IBM'er at Rochester) goes deep and wide on a variety of PASE topics.

== A Better Shell
Ok, we now know QShell should be used in limited fashion and that getting to the Korn shell (ksh) via `CALL QP2TERM` is better, but it still isn't the best.

Instead what you should be using is a more feature rich shell, like `bash`.  The Bourne Again Shell (bash) is now included with http://bit.ly/dw-5733ops-tools[5733OPS option 7].

**Why is Bash better?**

- **Tab key to complete.**  Instead of fully typing a directory or file name you can hit the tab key and it will auto complete it.
- **Short-cut keys.**  For example, Ctrl+A and Crtl+E go to the beginning and end of the current line, respectively.
- **Custom Prompt.** Bash allows you to customize your prompt to include things like the current directory, the current user. i.e. `[aaron@SPACES]/home/aaron/git$`

The other thing you need to know is that, while bash works in QP2TERM, it is fairly crippled.  For example, the tab-to-complete and short-cut keys don't work in QP2TERM because it isn't what called a teletypewriter (TTY)  type terminal.  To get a TTY terminal we need to start the `*SSHD` (SSH Daemon)footnote:[STRTCPSVR *SSHD] server and then use a client-side program (on the desktop) to connect to a bash shell on IBM i.

Once the `*SSHD` TCP server is started you can then connect to it using a terminal client, as shown below on Windows using https://kti.news/gitbash-for-windows[Git Bash].
