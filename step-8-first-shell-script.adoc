# First Shell Script

**Shell scripts are the CL of PASE.**  For example, sometimes you'll front an RPG program with a CL program to prime the environment (i.e. `OPNQRYF`).  Or other times you'll want to combine a bunch of CL commands into an easily callable program.  Shell scripts serve the same purpose.

A shell script is stored in a text file, usually with a `.sh` extension, though no extension is necessary; it's the content that is important.

Run the following command to create `first.sh`.

```
~% echo "echo 'hi'" > first.sh
```

What happened?  The http://www.computerhope.com/unix/uecho.htm[`echo`] command is for displaying a line of text.  In this case we directed the output from `echo` to `file.sh` using `>`. This is a simple and quick way to not only create a file but also occupy it with default content.

```
~% ./first.sh
zsh: permission denied: ./first.sh
