= Navigating the IFS

When you log in you are placed in a PASE shell and also into a directory in the IFS.  Previously we used `pwd` to print the current working directory.  Further, you can use the `ls` (list) command to display the contents of a directory.

Try the `ls` command for yourself and you should see something like the below.

```
~% ls                                                          
~%
```
Nothing was listed because the directory is empty.  Well, that's only partially true.  I just so happen to know there are "hidden" files in this directory.  Hidden files start with a period and aren't displayed by default.  Most all PASE commands have options that let you expound on what you want the command to do.  The PASE commands delivered with the IBM i operating system lack what are called "man pages", or manual pages, the documentation for the command.  Because of this we instead head to google and search for " http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/ls1.html[ls command] ".

In the documentation we see the `-a` option, as shown below.
```
       -a, --all
              do not hide entries starting with .
```
Now re-run the `ls` command with the `-a` option.
```
~% ls -a                                                       
.          ..         .ssh       .zprofile 
```
As you can see there are two hidden entries, `.ssh` is a hidden directory and `.zprofile` is a hidden file.  You'll also notice `.` and `..` (a single and double period). These are for when you want to use relative paths in your commands.

For example, if I wanted to change my current directory to that of my parent directory then I could issue the `cd` (change directory) command with two periods, as shown below.

```
% cd ..                                                       
/home% 
```

Notice how this changes the current directory in my prompt to `/home`.  Previously I was in my home directory (i.e. `/home/USRZ8IGS`) and it used home directory short form of `~`.  

I can run the `ls` command again to see my home directory (i.e. `USRZ8IGS`) because it is a child directory of the `/home` directory.

```
/home% ls                                                      
USRZ8IGS
```

Change back to your "home" directory by issuing the following command.

```
/home% cd ~
~%
```
Notice is changed your prompt back to `~%` - the short form for the "home" directory.

Now try to list the contents of a directory that's further up the tree from where you're at - the root directory.  The root is the single forward slash (`/`).
```
~% ls /                                                        
QOpenSys  dev       home      opt       tmp       var                           
bin       etc       lib       sbin      usr
```
Displaying the root (`/`) directory gives you perspective as to what might be installed.  For example, if PowerRuby was installed you'd see a `/PowerRuby` directory.  If I wanted to see what other open source tools were installed from IBM I could do the following.

```
~% ls /QOpenSys/QIBM/ProdData/OPS
Python-pkgs  Python2.7    Python3.4    tools
```
There are many more directories you can explore.  Here's a nicely formatted listing showing two levels deep of each root-level directory. 
```

You'll notice some of them have `->` in front of them.  That means they're a symbolic link.  Symbolic links are similar to Windows desktop shortcuts; they point to something elsewhere on the file system.

Go ahead and create your own symbolic link using the following `ln` command.
```
ln -s ~ /QOpenSys/myhome
```
Now use the `ls -al` to display the `/QOpenSys` directory so we can see the new symbolic link and where it points to.

```
~% ls -al /QOpenSys                                            
total 128

```
Change directory into `/QOpenSys/myhome` and create a new file with some content, as shown below.
```
~% cd /QOpenSys/myhome
/QOpenSys/myhome% echo 'something' > file.txt
```
Now display the contents in your home directory using the `~` (tilde) approach you should see the newly created `file.txt` file.
```
/QOpenSys/myhome% ls ~
file.txt
```
