# The `joe` Editor

There are many editors available for use on the character-based shell interface.  Editors like `vi`, `vim`, `nano`, and `joe`.  Compare these to 5250 editors like `SEU` or `EDTF`.

For the purposes of this lab we will focus on the http://joe-editor.sourceforge.net/[`joe`] editor because it works well in PASE whereas `vi` doesn't.

To edit a file with `joe` simply enter the following.

```
~% joe file.txt
```

Your shell should then look like the following screenshot.

You are now in a live editor that will allow you to modify the contents of `file.txt`.  Add the following lines as content in `file.txt`.

```
hi, I am on line 1
line 2
3rd is best
```

Now it's time to save the file and close the editor.  This is where keyboard shortcuts become very important because these character editors don't usually work with a mouse.  To learn what the keyboard shortcuts are press `Ctrl` + `KH` to bring up the `joe` editor's Help Screen, as shown below.

**NOTE:** Pressing `Ctrl` + `K` puts it into a special mode where it awaits an additional modifier (`H` in this example) to know what to do next.

Looking through that help display we can see the various key combinations that will perform an action.  In this scenario we want to save and exit, so `Ctrl` + `KX` should be pressed.  

**NOTE:** The `^` character signifies the `Ctrl` key.

**NOTE:** To hide the Help Screen press `Ctrl` + `KH` again.

Now display the contents of `file.txt` with the `cat` command to make sure our changes took place.

```
~% cat file.txt                                                
hi, I am on line 1
line 2
3rd is best
```

**Success!**

Open `file.txt` again and remove the third line.  To do this first position cursor on line 3 and then press `Ctrl` + `Y`.  For the sake of argument let's pretend you subsequently realized you needed line 3.  Never fear, you can exit without saving by selecting `Ctrl` + `C`.  

Go ahead and exit without saving changes.

**NOTE:** `joe` is great for times where you want to scroll up and and down in a large file.  This scenario is also a good time to use `Ctrl` + `X` because even if you accidentally made changes you don't want to keep them because you were only using `joe` to more easily navigate the file.  An alternative to displaying a file is to use the `cat`, `head`, or `tail` commands.
