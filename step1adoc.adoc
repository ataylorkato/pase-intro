There are four buttons which constitute actions you can take with your Space.  They are (left to right):

- *Shell prompt.*  You will use this to enter commands in the PASE environment on the IBM i.   This is browser-based and doesn't require any software to be installed on your desktop.

- *Editor.*  Where you will edit your source code and navigate the IFS (Integrated File System).  This is browser-based and doesn't require any software to be installed on your desktop.

- *Space Information.*  Here you will find information about your space such as user profile, database schemas (aka libraries), ports for your web app to listen, Space id, etc.

- *Delete Space.*  **WARNING!** If you select this option and the subsequent warning prompt, your Space will be deleted.  This CANNOT be undone.

[red]#Obvious# and [big red yellow-background]*very obvious*.
