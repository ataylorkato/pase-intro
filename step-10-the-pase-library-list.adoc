# The PASE Library List

OK, so PASE doesn't have a Library List in the same sense that we do with a 5250 session, but it does have something similar called a `PATH` environment variable.

Use the `echo` command to display the current value of the `PATH` environment variable.

```
~% echo $PATH
/QOpenSys/usr/bin:/usr/ccs/bin:/QOpenSys/usr/bin/X11:/usr/sbin:.:/usr/bin:/home/USRMAH25/bin
```

The `PATH` environment variable contains a colon (`:`) delimited list of directories that will be searched when a command is entered in the shell.  This is similar to how a 5250 session works in that if you do a `CALL PGM1`, and if it isn't in a library that's in your library list then it won't find the program.  The alternative is to fully qualify `PGM1` with the library it is in.  

The same concepts apply to the PASE `PATH` environment variable in that it will search the directories listed in `PATH` and nothing else.  

Run the following `ls` command to list the contents of directory `/QOpenSys/usr/bin` which is the first directory listed in the `PATH` environment variable.

```
~% ls /QOpenSys/usr/bin
X11                 dbx                 locale              rm

Notice both the `echo` and `ls` commands, the commands we just ran, are both listed in `/QOpenSys/usr/bin`.  The shell was able to locate them because they were in a directory listed in `PATH`.  However, that's not the whole story because some of these commands don't physically exist in `/QOpenSys/usr/bin` - instead you're seeing what are called **symbolic links**.

Run the following `ls` command, note the addition of the `-al` option so we can see more details in the listing.

**NOTE:** For the sake of brevity only a sampling of the results are displayed below.

```

When you see `l` in the first column of the results it means it is a symbolic link.  Then on the far right of the results we can see the name of the symbolic link (i.e. `git`) and where it points to (i.e. `/QOpenSys/QIBM/ProdData/OPS/tools/bin/git`).  

Think of a symbolic link as being similar to a short-cut on your Windows desktop.

## Try: Symbolic Links 

Let's try making our own symbolic links and add them to the `PATH`.  First create a new directory named `/test`.

```
~% mkdir /test
```

Now create a new script named `cheesecurds` in `/test` and set the permissions.

```
~% echo "echo 'Mmmm... deep fat fried cheese at the Minnesota State Fair'" > /test/cheesecurds
~% chmod +x /test/cheesecurds
```

At this point you should be in your home directory, but to be sure please run the below command.

```
~% cd ~
```

Now _attempt_ to invoke `cheesecurds` as shown below.

```
% cheesecurds
zsh: command not found: cheesecurds
```

It couldn't find the `cheesecurds` command.  Now try fully qualifying the call.

```
~% /test/cheesecurds
Mmmm... deep fat fried cheese at the Minnesota State Fair
```

**Success!!**

While that worked, we don't want to fully qualify the `cheesecurds` command every time we wish to invoke it.  We could solve this problem in one of two ways.  We could add directory `/test` to the `PATH` environment variable or create a symbolic link in `/QOpenSys/usr/bin` that points at `/test/cheesecurds`.  Heck, let's do both so we can stay on the topic of cheese curds as long as possible.

First let's create a symbolic link by running the following `ln` command.

```
~% ln -s /test/cheesecurds /QOpenSys/usr/bin/cheesecurds
```

Now `cheesecurds` can be invoked from anywhere, as shown below while in the home directory.

```
~% cheesecurds
Mmmm... deep fat fried cheese at the Minnesota State Fair
```

Remove the symbolic link using the following command so we can next test the `PATH` approach.

**NOTE:** Removing a symbolic link will not remove the target.

```
~% rm /QOpenSys/usr/bin/cheesecurds
```

Before going further, please make sure you get the following error when running the `cheesecurds` command.

```
~% cheesecurds
zsh: command not found: cheesecurds
```

Now run the following command to add the `/test` directory to the `PATH` environment variable so it is included in the search for commands.

```
~% export PATH=/test:$PATH
```

The `export` command is used to set an environment variable for not only the current shell session but also any child sessions that are created from this session.  In this case we're placing the `/test` directory at the beginning of the `PATH` environment variable and then appending the existing contents of `PATH`.

Now try running the `cheesecurds` command again.

```
~% cheesecurds
Mmmm... deep fat fried cheese at the Minnesota State Fair
```

**Success!**

## Please proceed to the next step.
